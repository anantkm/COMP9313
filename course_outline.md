<h2 id="_academic_honesty_and_plagiarism">9. Academic honesty and plagiarism</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Copying assignments is unacceptable. Assignments will be checked. The penalties for copying range from receiving no marks for the assignment, through receiving a mark of 00 FL for the course, to expulsion from UNSW (for repeat offenders). Allowing someone to copy your work counts as plagiarism, even if you can prove that it is your work.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are several on-line sources to help you understand what plagiarism is and how it is dealt with at UNSW:</p></div>

</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Make sure that you read and understand these. Ignorance is not accepted as an excuse for plagiarism. In particular, you are also responsible that your assignment files are not accessible by anyone but you by setting the correct permissions in your CSE directory and code repository, if using. Note also that plagiarism includes paying or asking another person to do a piece of work for you and then submitting it as your own work.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>UNSW has an ongoing commitment to fostering a culture of learning informed by academic integrity.
All UNSW staff and students have a responsibility to adhere to this principle of academic integrity.
Plagiarism undermines academic integrity and is not tolerated at UNSW. Plagiarism at UNSW is
defined as using the words or ideas of others and passing them off as your own.</p></div>
